		<p>As a young girl interested in every sporting activity, it felt genetically impossible to achieve any of my dreams. As an athlete, it was a serious struggle to fight off unwanted weight. As a footballer, It was a sincere battle chasing the ball from one end of the field to the other.</p>
		<blockquote><p>A blockquote: In the words of Sam smith: Did I want to be somebody else?, Yes. Did I want to do better but couldnt?, Yes!</p></blockquote>
		<p>As it felt almost impossible to do the things I loved most, I decided to learn and embrace other ideas. Keeping fit was a part of me I was never willing to let go off without a fight, It had to be possible, and slowly, I welcomed other ideas I almost never knew existed. I learnt about different types of workouts, namely;</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cardio</li>
			<li>HIIT</li>
			<li>Compound movements</li>
			<li>Aerobic exercises</li>
			<li>Pilates</li>
			<li>Yoga</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Gradually, i became familiar with various types, did a few on some workout downloaded apps, then it all began to make sense, I needed to shed fat and was going to adopt whatever possible means necessary. For some months, I practiced a few, when I wasn't satisfied or seeing reasonable progress, I moved to another. But In my quest, I was missing the major solution provider. WAS I EATING RIGHT?, Absolutely not!, I was doing 1000 skips with a waist trainer strapped so tight, worried about getting the results I thought I had put sufficient work into but GOOD NUTRITION was the thing I lacked and then it all eventually came together </p>

		<p>In my understanding of the various types of exercises, I had to adopt the one in line with my goals. WHAT WAS MY GOAL?: Well, I wanted to build lean muscle and that required me shedding fat while maintaining my muscles, in common terms, The goal was to look "toned". Hence, on the 31st January, 2022, I started doing compound movements, lifting heavy, cardio after workouts blahblah. You see, in my research, I figured, in order to build muscle, you had to consume lots of protein, but what i forgot to note was that, you had to consume lots of protein, less carbs and healthy fats. OMO! I ate lots of protein o, trust me, but I didn't eat less of the other classes of food, as a result, in my first few months, I blew up, thighs got bigger, face got fatter, and then I knew I was doing something wrong, trust me to figure out what it was and then I got right back on track. So here I am, adopting good nutrition as part of my lifestyle, sometimes I slip deliberately because 'I cannot come and kee myself'. It's been a bitter sweet journey so far, especially with the nutrition thing(weeps)but I'm getting my desired results and that's what truly matters.</p>
